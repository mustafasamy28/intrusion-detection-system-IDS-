# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System using supervised machine learning techniques to classify network activity as normal or malicious.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze network traffic data and detect intrusions using machine learning models. The dataset used is preprocessed and trained to identify patterns of known attacks.

## ðŸ§  Skills & Concepts Used

- Python & Jupyter Notebooks
- Data Preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
- Feature Selection and Engineering
- Machine Learning (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is a subset of the KDD99 or similar intrusion detection dataset.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output

After training, the model achieved the following:

- **Accuracy**: 97.8%
- **Precision**: 96.5%
- **Recall**: 95.2%
- **Confusion Matrix**:

| TP: 970 | FN: 30 | | FP: 20 | TN: 980 |
